  <hr>
  <p class='descr'>At present there is no platform to connect students & staff all over India. A platform/portal where students could put up their projects, share their problems, contribute to projects, help in academics, suggest new ideas, just come together for any possible work. This will help them for all over development, inform them about current advances in curriculumâ€™s, etc. You know you always wanted to ask some question in the lecture but you were shy or were afraid because you thought the question might be stupid or your friends might laugh at you.</p>
